Hello, there!

My name is Nojus, and I’m an electronics engineering student from Lithuania. This site is my portfolio, where I share the projects I’ve worked on and document my journey in electronics.

I’m passionate about creating and experimenting—whether it’s designing circuits, programming microcontrollers, or exploring new ideas. Each project here reflects my learning process and love for problem-solving.

Feel free to look around, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you’d like to connect or collaborate!
