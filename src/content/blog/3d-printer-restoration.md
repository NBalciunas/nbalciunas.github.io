## The story

I was walking around a flea market checking out old electronics.
There I saw an old beaten up Anycubic Photon 3D printer.
I decided to buy it hoping that it was working properly and only needed a deep cleaning.
Sadly, when I got it home I discovered that it had a dead LCD matrix, but at least I knew that it was still alive.
So I did what I had to and ordered a new one from Aliexpress.
While waiting for it to deliver I completely took apart the entire printer to clean it because the there was a resin spill.
After a few days of scrubbing the parts and putting the printer together the printer was a bit cleaner and most importantly wasn't sticky with resin anymore.
I did mess up and accidentally used the wrong solution on of the yellow transparent plastic windows and made it cloudy, but I like to think of it as adding a bit of personality to the printer.
When the replacement LCD matrix arrive I replaced the old broken one and the printer finally worked.
I bought myself a bottle of resin and made my first print with this printer.
Now I have a pretty decent SLA 3D printer.
